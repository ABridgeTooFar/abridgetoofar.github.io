## Welcome to my GitHub Page

The main purpose of this page is to maintain a library of browser-enabled python scripts capable of executing in sandboxed environments. Not all of these examples work in Internet Explorer... I recommend using the Chromium browser for best results.

### Sample code

- [Hello, Brython](hello_world\brython.html)
- more to come
